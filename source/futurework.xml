    <li>
      <b>Retest of findings</b>
      <br/> When mitigations for the vulnerabilities described in this report have been deployed, a
      repeat test should be performed to ensure that they are effective and have not introduced
      other security problems. </li>
    <li>
      <b>Regular security assessments</b>
      <br/>
      Let us emphasize that security is a process, and this penetration test is just a single snapshot.
      Security must be continuously evaluated and improved.
      Regular audits and ongoing improvements are essential in order to maintain control of your corporate information security.
